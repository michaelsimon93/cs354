For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

cache1D
-------

Describe how you tested your code to verify that it works.

	I made sure that each element of the array was 
	set and accessable by iterating through the array and 
	printing the contents in that location. I then inputed the output
	into a file and checked the values in the file.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

	Instruction cache misses:       5951
	Instruction cache references:   695573
	Data cache misses:              107140
	Data cache references:          646506	

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

	I-cache Hit Ratio = 0.99144

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

	D-cache Hit Ratio = 0.83423

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

	Instruction cache misses:       1171
	Instruction cache references:   695573
	Data cache misses:              15070
	Data cache references:          646506

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

	I-cache Hit Ratio = 0.99832

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

	D-cache Hit Ratio = 0.97669

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

	Instruction cache misses:       713
	Instruction cache references:   695573
	Data cache misses:              8895
	Data cache references:          646506

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

	I-cache Hit Ratio = 0.99897

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

	D-cache Hit Ratio = 0.98624	

Which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?

	The best block size for the I-cache could be 4 or 64. This is because it has 
	a good hit ratio and the latency may be smaller than the 64 block 
	size. Therefore, it is difficult to see if the cache will improve 
	performance with the 64 block size because the increase in 
	latency is unkown. If the latency is not large than the 64 block 
	size is the best.

Which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
  size affect the hit ratio for this program?
  
	The best block size for I-cache is 64. This is because the D-cache
	needs to be large. This reduces the amount of miss penalties. The 
	larger the size the more data the cache can hold, thus having more
	hits. However, the loss comes from a miss which has a longer time 
	the larger the block size.

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for these 2 programs.
Justify your statistics.

	The I-cache hit ratios for the two programs was the same after 
	rounding to five digits. The instructions cahce is about the same 
	because the instructions are not really changing between the two 
	programs. Meaning the two programs handle the instructions in the 
	same manner. Therefore, between the two programs the misses and 
	references will be relatively the same. 

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for these 2 programs.
Explain any differences.

	The D-cache hit ratios were quite different considering the amount
	of references. The cache2Drows program had a hit ratio of 0.99116 and the 
	cache2Dcols program had a hit ratio of 0.87488. These are different because
	it is accessing the data in a different manner. In C the array is aloted in 
	memory by row then column. When accessing the array first by row then 
	iterating through the rows is how the array was aloted. This is because 
	memory is one demensional and will save the contents in a row in a consecutive
	group. On the other hand the program that accessed columns and then filled 
	each column will have to jump around memory causeing more misses and more 
	time wasted because of the miss penalty.
